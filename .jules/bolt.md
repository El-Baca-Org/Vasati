## 2026-05-08 - [XML Parsing Optimization]
**Learning:** Parsing the XML document in the constructor of `zaman` class without caching causes a significant performance bottleneck (around 40ms per 100 instantiations). Repeatedly loading the file creates high overhead.
**Action:** Used a C++11 method-local magic static and an immediately invoked lambda to cache the `cityinfo` XML node (`zaman::sehir`), reducing 100 instantiations from ~40ms to ~14ms.

## 2024-05-11 - [XML Lookup Optimization]
**Learning:** Repeatedly calling `pugi::xml_node::find_child_by_attribute` to look up prayer times by `dayofyear` is an O(N) linear search bottleneck that slows down `zaman` class instantiations.
**Action:** Replaced it with an O(1) array lookup. Since `dayofyear` acts as a sequential 0-based index (0-365), we can cache the `const char*` text of each `prayertimes` node into a static `cached_nodes[400]` array using a magic static block. This reduced instantiation time nearly by half.
